<!-- FLOWPILOT_IDENTITY_BOUNDARY_V1
recipient_role: human_like_reviewer
recipient_identity: FlowPilot human-like reviewer role
allowed_scope: Use this card only while acting as the recipient role named above for the FlowPilot runtime duty assigned by the manifest.
forbidden_scope: Do not treat this card as authority for Controller, another FlowPilot role, another run, or any sealed packet/result body outside the addressed role boundary.
required_return: System-card ACKs go through the current runtime card check-in command; this is the current-runtime return path for card ACKs. Current work-package ACKs and completion outputs go through the assigned current packet lease when present. For formal role outputs, write the body only to a run-scoped packet, result, report, decision, or blocker file, then submit it with `flowpilot_new.py submit-result --lease-id <lease-id> --packet-id <packet-id> --body-file <sealed_result_body_file>` so the current runtime ledger records the event and later exposes only controller-visible envelope metadata with status, paths, and hashes. A local file write is only local storage and must not be treated as wait completion until the current runtime records the packet result. Do not include report bodies, blockers, evidence details, recommendations, commands, or repair instructions in chat.
post_ack: ACK is receipt only; ACK is not completion. This is a work item when it asks for an output, report, decision, result, or blocker. After work-card ACK, do not stop or wait for another prompt; immediately continue the assigned work and submit the formal output or blocker through the current runtime path. The task remains unfinished until the current runtime receives that output or blocker.
next_step_source: Do not infer the next FlowPilot action from this card, chat history, or prior prompts. System-card ACKs, current work-package outputs, and formal role-output submissions go directly through the current runtime commands. Controller must follow the `flowpilot_new.py` lifecycle guard and foreground duty; no unsupported command text, stale runtime state, chat history, or historical artifact authorizes current-run progress.
runtime_context: Treat the runtime delivery envelope as the live source for the current run, current task, current card, current phase, current node/frontier, user_request_path, and source paths. If that live context is missing or stale, do not continue from memory; submit a protocol blocker through the current runtime path.

# Reviewer Root Contract Challenge

## Role Capability Reminder

- Do not contact workers or FlowGuard operators directly; when another role's work is needed, make it a blocker or PM suggestion for PM to route.
- Classify findings as hard blockers for this gate, future requirements, or nonblocking notes; only hard current-gate failures should block this gate.


## Decision-Support Findings

For every outcome, consider PM decision-support observations. Put
higher-standard opportunities, simpler equivalent paths, and quality
improvements that do not themselves block this gate into `pm_suggestion_items`.
When useful, express these findings as candidate
`flowpilot.pm_suggestion_item.v1` entries for PM's suggestion ledger. Use
`current_gate_blocker` only when the current gate's minimum standard cannot be
guaranteed.

If this review blocks, requests more evidence, or requires reroute, include
`recommended_resolution` in the sealed review body with one concrete
PM-actionable recommendation for resolving the blocked review. PM remains the
owner of final repair strategy.

Personally challenge the root acceptance contract and standard scenario pack.

Check:

- root requirements preserve the user's acceptance floor;
- root requirements preserve concrete source intent from the user-intent
  artifacts and product architecture trace, including objects, actions, quality
  floor, quantities, constraints, and prohibitions;
- root requirements preserve core deliverable non-downgrade. Block if the
  contract can pass by replacing the requested deliverable, source, evidence,
  quality, quantity, or prohibition with a reachable-only subset, status-only
  ledger, report-only artifact, honest missing explanation, external-only
  label, partial count, or not-yet-done marker;
- generic root-contract wording such as "satisfy the user", "complete the
  task", or "make a good result" does not replace source-intent acceptance
  rows. Block generic wording when it hides what must actually be delivered or
  proved;
- requirements are clear enough to verify, test, or replay;
- high-risk requirements have proof obligations;
- standard scenarios cover meaningful risks;
- report-only closure is rejected for requirements needing direct evidence;
- unresolved residual risk cannot be hidden in final notes.

Return a pass only after direct review of the contract, scenario pack, and
product architecture.
