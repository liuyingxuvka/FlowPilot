# AGENTS.md

## Operating Rule

This repository implements the `flowpilot` Codex skill.

Before implementation work, read:

- `HANDOFF.md`
- `.flowpilot/state.json` if this clone is already inside an active
  FlowPilot-controlled route
- `.flowpilot/routes/route-001/flow.json` if present for the active route
- `docs/flowguard_preflight_findings.md`
- `simulations/capability_model.py`
- `simulations/meta_model.py`

## FlowGuard Requirement

Use real FlowGuard. Do not create a fake mini-framework.

Before changing behavior-bearing protocol, route, or skill logic, verify:

```powershell
python -c "import flowguard; print(flowguard.SCHEMA_VERSION)"
```

If the change affects the project-control flow, update and rerun:

```powershell
python simulations/run_meta_checks.py
```

If the change affects skill/capability routing, update and rerun:

```powershell
python simulations/run_capability_checks.py
```

## Coordination

Keep edits scoped. This project is expected to be worked on by agents that may
resume from local files rather than chat history.

When this repository is being developed under an active FlowPilot route, update
that workspace's `.flowpilot/` state when changing the plan:

- route structure changes: create a new route version;
- execution progress: update `state.json`, heartbeat records, and node reports;
- capability decisions: update `capabilities.json` and capability evidence;
- major verified milestone: write a checkpoint.

## Documentation Language

Use English for repository files. The project is intended for public GitHub
distribution and cross-agent handoff.

## Hard Gates

Never silently change these without explicit user approval:

- frozen acceptance contract;
- release/publish/deploy actions;
- major technology stack changes;
- destructive or irreversible changes;
- handling secrets or private account data;
- lowering completion standards.
